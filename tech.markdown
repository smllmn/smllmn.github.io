Having previously run Ubuntu and Gentoo systems, my daily driver is now
the Manjaro i3 Community Edition. My window manager of choice has been i3
for several years now.

In no particular order, my favourite applications:
* Editor: neovim (previously vim)
* File manager: ranger
* Social media/communication manager: rambox (previously Franz)
* Bar: i3bar (previously polybar)
* Email client: Nylas
* MPD Client: ncmpcpp
