I'm a PhD student studying statistics at Cardiff University. I'm working with
[Dr. Andreas Artemiou](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98629-artemiou-andreas),
[Prof. Paul Harper](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98650-harper-paul)
and (formerly) [Dr. Jennifer Morgan](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98661-morgan-jennifer)
on methods for dimension reduction of text data
with applications to healthcare.

Before that, I studied mathematics at Cardiff University. During that time
I worked on a summer research project funded by the London Mathematical Society
with Dr Artemiou looking at ways to mitigate the effects of class imbalance on
the principal support vector machine method for dimension reduction.

I'm also interested in computers and all things related. I've dabbled in
Haskell and Idris, written code for the Game Boy Advance years after that was
cool, and (for the moment) run an Ubuntu system with i3 as my window manager
and polybar as my bar of choice.
